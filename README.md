## About
A more extensive readme and, well, program, is coming soon. This includes V1.0, standalone builds and releases, and better looking code.

A neat little python3 autoclicker which is faster, more streamlined, and offers some the most wanted capabilities where competing products fail.

Here's a totally non-biased comparison with my historical go-to solution for spamming M1.

## Running from source
To start the autoclicker run the shortcut if you're on windows, or run "main.pyw"

If your system doesn't recognise the file type simply choose to open it WITH "pythonw.exe". DO NOT choose "python.exe" in your python install folder, this causes it to open with the console.

## Common python install locations
Common Python install locations:
C:\Users\P3tray\AppData\Local\Programs -> used for non-admin installs
C:\Program Files\ -> used for admin installs

## Configuration
Settings and new profiles can be made inside the program, don't forget to click save if you want to keep them, because you guessed it, they won't save.
Alternatively, you can edit a json file directly, this is currently required for modifying keybinds.
Inside "deps" there is "settings.json". This allows you to configure settings which save between sessions without opening the autoclicker.
## Enjoy!
